# Movie Recommender System

Building a recommender system involves using various methods to predict user preferences based on historical data. There are two primary methods for building recommender systems: Collaborative Filtering and Content Based Filtering. Collaborative Filtering can be further divided into two approaches: user-based and item-based. In user-based collaborative filtering, the system identifies similar users based on their movie ratings, and generates recommendations based on their preferences. On the other hand, item-based collaborative filtering works by determining the similarity between items, and then identifying users who would be likely to enjoy the selected item. One challenge of collaborative filtering is the "cold start" problem, where the system struggles to make recommendations for new users or items with limited historical data.

In contrast, content-based filtering uses features of users or items to generate recommendations. The system creates profiles for users or items based on observed features, and then finds similar items or users to recommend. This method is less affected by the cold start problem, as users or items can be described based on their characteristics, rather than solely relying on historical interactions.

In my model, I chose to implement user-based collaborative filtering. I selected this method as it was the simplest approach for my dataset, which included user ID, movie ID, and ratings. I believed that a content-based filtering method would require more features for both the users and movies, making it more complex. Additionally, I determined that the cold start issue would be negligible for my dataset, as there were sufficient interactions to fill in missing data with a filler value. Furthermore, I found that missing a single recommendation was not significant, as the majority of recommendations were accurate.
